# Codecademy-Resources
A small repo of resources for my students on Codecademy.

You're free to clone this repo to get access to code samples from seminars or make issues and ask questions.

## Contributors

This set of resources wouldn't be half as good as they are if it wasn't for the exceptional work of the other seminars, lectures, guidance, and resources of my colleagues.

I also must thank my students who's questions have made me a better explainer, a better teacher, and a better learner myself.

I extend my sincerest thanks to all of them.
